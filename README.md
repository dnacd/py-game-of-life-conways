it's *Game of Life*, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician *John Horton Conway* in *1970*.  
It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requirings no further input.  
It is Turing complete and can simulate a universal constructor or any other Turing machine.  
  
## usage
_This is my implementation of GoL with basic cells and background visualisation based on Python/pygame module._  
_You have all settings in data/settings.py and you can change cells color and background in data/crect.py if you wanna change sound welcome to data/banks/sounds.py_  
_In the start you must choice soundbanks, if you need sound in game just tap "y" in the input field, then choice generation rate per second limit. Enjoy_ :)
