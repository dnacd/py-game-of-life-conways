    Hi, its Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. \n\
    It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requirings no further input. \n\
    It is Turing complete and can simulate a universal constructor or any other Turing machine.\n\n \
        its my interpretation of GoL with basic cells and background visualisation based on Python/pygame module.\n\n\
    You have all settings in data/settings.py and you can change cells color and background in data/crect.py if you wanna change sound welcome to data/banks/sounds.py \n\
       In the start you must choice soundbanks, if you need sound in game just tap "y" in the input field, then choice generation rate per second limit. Enjoy :)\n\n'
